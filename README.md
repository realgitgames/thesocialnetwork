# thesocialnetwork

A git based [indie web](https://indieweb.org/) social network.

## TL DR

The idea is that everybody can create an independent social network by "just" forking the repo and starting the app to create content and befriend others that also have a fork of this repo. Networking happens by creating posts and replying to other people's posts kind of like on twitter or FB. Limitations only determined by what the devs can come up with, but markdown should give us enough functionality.

## For developers

Ideally everything is implemented just using the Github API and later on that could also be ported to other platforms like Gitlab?!

Collaboration is not only welcome, but key to making this project fun and successful at the same time.

Since the more devs are present, the more ideas for tech stacks come up, so ideally the concept should not depend on which tech is used. Let developers create their own implementation by creating a PR for a variation.
